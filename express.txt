4 majors features of Express:
	Middleware
	Routing
	Extensions
	Views

				Middleware
						—In contrast to vanilla Node, wher
						e your requests flow through only
						one  function,  Express  has  a  middleware
						stack,  which  is  effectively  an  array  of
						functions.

				Routing
						—Routing is a lot like middleware, but the functions are called only when
						you visit a specific URL with a specific HTTP method. For example, you could only
						run a request handler when the browser visits yourwebsite.com/about.

				Extensions to request and response objects
						—Express extends the request and response
						objects with extra methods and prop
						erties for developer convenience.

				Views
						—Views  allow  you  to  dynamically  render  
						HTML.  This  both  allows  you  to change the 
						HTML on the fly and to write the HTML in other languages.
